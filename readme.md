# OpenInventory Backend

This is the official repo of the OpenInventory-Backend.
OpenInvenory is an open source inventory system written in Go and Typescript. This frontend is based on angular and is designed to have really short response times. Test it out yourself.

## Setup
If you want to use OpenInventory, take a look at the OpenInventory-Backend repository. From there you can download the application. You can find an setup tutorial on my Youtube Channel.

## Why OpenInventory?
If you search on the internet, there are many good inventory solutions. But most of them are closed source and you have to pay much money for them. OpenInventory is the absolute opposite. It is open source and you are able to host it yourself without extra costs. Furthermore out there are many people, who can help to optimize OpenInventory and make it more secure and fast.

## API Documentation
I will add an full API documentation later, because probably there will be some big changes.
