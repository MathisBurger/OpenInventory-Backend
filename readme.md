# Information

---
Open Inventory is an open source inventory system build with go and angular. <br>
It started as a fun project for private use, but scaled up to a production software.<br>
Therefore I like everyone who is using OpenInventory as his inventory system.

# Support

---
Because I am the only one developing this project, I can only handle a few issues.
Therefore <br> I am only picking the best and most important one. But I am going to
add every enhancement idea to this project. Just open an issue with the enhancement tag.

# Updates

---
There will be some updates in the future adding new features. I am trying to add
some new features every 3 months. Switching to a newer version is quite easy. You only
need to download the newest web assets and <br>
backend binary to update.
