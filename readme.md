# Information

---
Open Inventory is an open source inventory system build with go and angular. <br>
It started as a fun project for private use, but scaled up to a production software.<br>
Therefore I like everyone who is using OpenInventory as his inventory system.

# Support

---
Because I am the only one developing this project, I can only handle a few issues.
Therefore <br> I am only picking the best and most important one. But I am going to
add every enhancement idea to this project. Just open an issue with the enhancement tag.

# Updates

---
There will be no future updates of this project. The last stable build is
v0.0.5 Mango. There are some new features in the development branch. You can 
build the executable and the web-assets by yourself, if you want to use
features like barcode support. I do recommend doing this, because I will not
publish this feature as stable build.
